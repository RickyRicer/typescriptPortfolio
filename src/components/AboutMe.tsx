Beyond the screen, I'm a proud father who cherishes every moment with my family. When I'm not immersing myself in lines of code, you'll find me exploring the depths as a certified scuba diver or enjoying quality time with my beloved Bernese Mountain Dog, Mando. From diving into the crypto/NFT space to tinkering with 3D printers and delving into the worlds of video games and sci-fi, there's always something new to learn and discover. Life's an adventure, and I'm here to embrace every moment of it, both personally and professionally!")}</p>
